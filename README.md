I'm Anastasios, graduate from a data analysis program with a strong foundation in SQL, Tableau, and Python. I bring a unique blend of technical skills and hands-on business experience to the table. I worked in the food industry as an industrial clerk for four years, where I helped with the IFS certification process and secure new clients. This experience gave me deep insights into the challenges business owners face and the importance of data-driven decision-making. 
Iâ€™m excited to bring my passion for data analysis and problem-solving to a dynamic team to tackle even bigger Problems.

Skills:  python | pandas | matplotlib | seaborn | scikit-learn | scipy | SQL | Excel | Tableau

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a cluster analysis on a Travel Agency dataset
