I'm Anastasios, graduate from a data analysis program with a strong foundation in SQL, Tableau, and Python. I bring a unique blend of technical skills and hands-on business experience to the table. I worked in the food industry as an administrative clerk for four years, where I helped with the IFS certification process (globally recognised product quality and safety standards) and secure new clients. 
This experience gave me deep insights into the challenges business owners face and the importance of data-driven decision-making. For example by performing a Hazard Analysis on the critical control Points (HACCP) and implementing Tracking methods to ensure Quality. 

Iâ€™m excited to bring my passion for data analysis and problem-solving to a dynamic team to tackle even bigger Problems.

Skills:  python | pandas | matplotlib | seaborn | scikit-learn | scipy | SQL | Excel | Tableau

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a cluster analysis on a Travel Agency dataset
